# ExpenseTracker
The Project should be run on easyphp devserver and phpmyadmin.
Steps:
--A database named 'phptutorial' was created consisting of two tables : 'totalbalance' and 'transactions'.
--'totalbalance' - store 'id' which is auto-incremented, 'username', 'balance' , 'totincome' and 'totexpense'.
--'transactions' - store 'id' , 'user' , 'tname' , 'income' , 'expense' and 'tdate'

Notes:
--The link to the website is: http://etrackernj.atwebpages.com/
--When the link is clicked to reach the subdomain in the web browser, only the login page is displayed and the program does not execute any further as i have used localhost to run the project.
